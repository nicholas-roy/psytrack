class memoize(object):
    '''
    This class is a way to cache the result of a function, as well as its 1st and 2nd derivatives.
    SciPy's minimize() needs to be passed distinct objects for the jacobian + hessian, typically
    other functions that would be calculated separately. With Memoize, you can store this info
    from a function that returns [output, jac, hess] in this class object, then access the
    jacobian or hessian attribute with minimize().

    Args:
        a function that returns [value, jacobian, hessian]
